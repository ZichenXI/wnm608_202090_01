         <h2>The Mandalorian™</h2>
         <div class="article-body">
            <p>Today, the LEGO Group reveals its latest construction set featuring the beloved character from the Lucasfilm series Star Wars: The Mandalorian™. The LEGO® Star Wars™ The Child construction set is inspired by the small-in-size but powerful-in-charisma character, the Child (or Baby Yoda as fans have affectionately dubbed the character), from the series. The building set will be available globally from October 30th, with pre-orders starting today as part of the Mando Mondays program announcement from Disney and Lucasfilm.</p>
            <p>Measuring just under 20cm (7.8 inches) in height, builders can experience the fun of building a set inspired by one of their favourite The Mandalorian™ stars in 1,073 pieces. Designed for fans aged 10 and over, builders can make the model their own. With a posable head, movable ears and an adjustable mouth, fans can choose from a range of the Child’s famous expressions when putting their finished model on display.</p>
            <p>“When I received the challenge to create a LEGO brick-built version of the Child, I knew that I had to get it just right” says Michael Lee Stockwell, Design Manager, LEGO® Star Wars™. “The goal was to capture the charm, and above all, the cuteness of the character, so we worked meticulously, choosing and placing each and every brick. We even included authentic details like the gearstick knob – a favourite toy of the Child as seen in the series.”</p>

            <h2>The Mos Eisley Cantina™ </h2>
            <div class="article-body">
               <p>Coming from a galaxy far, far away and into to the homes of LEGO enthusiasts and Star Wars fans across the world – the LEGO Group’s new LEGO® Star Wars building set, the Mos Eisley Cantina™ set, will dazzle adult builders and film fans alike. Bringing to life one of the Skywalker saga’s most iconic locations, the new set is sure to become an instant classic as fans immerse themselves in the famous cantina’s world of smugglers, musicians, bounty hunters and Jedi Knights.</p>
               <p>The impressive building kit gives adult LEGO fans the chance to relax and enjoy a mindful building experience as they reconnect with their passion for the original trilogy. Intrepid builders can even open up the set’s removable roof to admire its intricate details and act out their favourite Star Wars: A New Hope scenes, using iconic character mini-figures including Luke SkywalkerTM, Han SoloTM, C-3POTM. Additionally, the set features seven character mini-figures that have been introduced in LEGO form for the first time, including Ponda BabaTM, Dr. EvazanTM, GarindanTM, and more.</p>
               <p>As they embark on their journey to bring Mos Eisley’s quintessential taverna to life, films lovers and Star Wars devotees will be thrilled to discover the set’s special features, such as the attachable buildings, two landspeeders – one of which has never been built in LEGO before - and a dewback LEGO Star Wars figure. The LEGO® Star Wars Mos Eisley Cantina™ is also dotted with hidden details throughout, such a “Wanted” poster featuring R2-D2 and C-3PO, to the kyber crystals hidden in one of the exterior buildings.</p>
               <p>Once built, the 3,187-piece LEGO® Star Wars Mos Eisley Cantina™ construction set makes for an extraordinary display piece, standing at over 7.5” (19cm) high, 20.5” (52cm) wide and 23” (58cm) deep when opened.</p>

         <div class="article-body">
            <p>Part of the Master Builder series, the new Star Wars building kit is the latest example of how the LEGO Group aims to inspire builders to build, rebuild and get excited by the process of creation. Speaking about the creative process behind the new building kit, set designer Cesar Soares said:</p>
            <p>“The first time I watched the cantina scene in Star Wars: A New Hope, I was just 12 years old. I remember thinking, ‘this is where the adventure starts!’ Years later, when I then became a LEGO® Star Wars ™ designer in 2016, this was the first set I built. With this design, we’ve added external buildings like the Jawa shop, refined the details, and chosen an impressive 21 minifigure characters, including all-new alien figures. I love that all Star Wars characters have cool backstories, no matter how briefly they appear, it wasn’t easy to decide which characters to include in the set, but we hope fans will love the entire model and its line-up of heroes and villains.”</p>
            <p>There is a huge variety of LEGO® Star Wars™ building sets available to delight fans, helping them reimagine their favourite scenes, create their own epic stories, or just build and display the awesome models, including the LEGO Star Wars Luke’s Landspeeder, the TIE Fighter Pilot Helmet™ and A-wing Starfighter™ construction sets. The Mos Eisley Cantina set is perfect for those looking for a new building challenge – making it ideal for ages 18+ to enjoy solo or with friends and family.</p>
